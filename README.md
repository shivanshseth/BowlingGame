# Bowling Game 

### Instructions
**Please put your initals in front of the task that you are picking up, along with the deadline for the task**

Initals: 
  1. Shivansh - Sh
  2. Joseph - Jo
  3. Jai - Ja

Also use the format
```
  (<Initials> | <Deadline>) 
  Eg: (Ja|28) 
```

### Tasks to be completed:

* Code Analysis and Refactoring 
  > We will use the principles such as coupling, cohesion, delegation vs. inheritance, assignment of responsibilities, elimination of bad code smells.
  - [ ] Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the code (narrative + table) (Sh|31)
  - (Review Required) [X] UML class diagram of the initial design. (Ja|31)
  - [ ] UML diagrams (sequence diagram) to provide insights to key static and dynamic characteristics of the program before and after refactoring.
  - (Review Required) [X] Table of each class of the design and its responsibility (Ja|31)
  - [ ] Choose metrics to evaluate the initial design and find out sections to refactor (Sh|30)
  - [ ] Choose the sections to refactor + Document (tabular form)
  - [ ] Updated UML Diagrams with the new refactored code
  >  To highlight the improvements you made by refactoring the design, show sequence diagrams for two important operations executing in the original design and in your refactored design.
  >  A narrative outlining how the refactored design reflects a balance among competing criteria such as low coupling, high cohesion, separation of concerns, information hiding, the Law of Demeter, extensibility, reusability 
  - [ ] Evaluate the change based on the decided metric.

* Feature Implementation
  - [ ] Make the code extensible 
  > An extensible system is one whose internal structure and dataflow are minimally or not affected by new or modified functionality, for example recompiling or changing the original source code might be unnecessary when changing a system's behavior, either by the creator or other programmers.
  - [ ] Add multiplayer functionality - Provide an option to add and store player names. 
  - [ ] Add a database to layer to implement the persistence of scores and players. 
  - [ ] Provide a searchable view to make ad-hoc queries to the system - eg: highest/lowest, top player, etc.
  - [ ] Implement pause and play functionality (context) that is available even after closing the game. Ability to continue existing game. 
  
* Testing
  > It goes without saying that everyone developing their section will test to ensure that their unit is completely functional. We can use Github Issues to raise issues caused during development, in order to allow others to contribute to the problems. 
  - [ ] Spend some time to ensure that the completely integrated game works as required.
  - [ ] Verifying that all the UML diagrams have been made correctly. 
  - [ ] Finishing touches to the final PDF
 
* CONTRIBUTING (please read)
  - For every feature being developed please use a new branch. This will allow everyone to perform unit testing easily and will hopefully result in lesser merge issues. 
  - Please set a deadline for the task that you are picking up, and please provide an update by that date, so that even if you're not able to complete the task for whatever reason (less time, big bug, etc.) somebody will be able to help. 
  - We also don't have much time, so we have to step up the game to be able to complete all the requirement by time.
